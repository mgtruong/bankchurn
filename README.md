# bankchurn
This is the final project for my data mining course. The purpose was to predict customer churn based on a bank dataset by creating a predictive model in R.

# About the Dataset
The used dataset was received from Kaggle.com. It contains 14 different pieces of information about 10,000 customers, such as their age and their estimated salary. This project aims to predict whether a customer leaves the bank and what variables are most significant in making this decision. Banks can use the predictive models built from this report to determine whether a future customer will leave based on different variables, anticipating potential churners and having time to transform them into loyal clients. 

# Data Mining Techniques
The data mining techniques used in this project are exploratory data analysis, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest. After conducting logistic regression, the variables that have a statistically significant relationship with the response variable were revealed. Alongside the logistic regression model, a classification decision tree and random forest model were constructed and compared to see which is the best predictive model. It was determined that the random forest model had the most effective predictive power, and the most important variables were then revealed.
